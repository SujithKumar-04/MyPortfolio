This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file.

In a production environment, you would upload an actual PDF file through the Django admin interface.
The file will be stored in the media directory and served to users when they click the 'Download Resume' button.

For development purposes, modify the download_resume view to handle this placeholder scenario.
